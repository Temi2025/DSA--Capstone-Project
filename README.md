    These product category enjoyed highest records of discount ranging from 50% and more.
  - Average Rating from range of (1-5) has been 4.8, which means the customers satisfaction is met.
  - Office product , Toys & game has 0% and 12% respectively on discounted percentage because we sell at actual price of purchase without profit margin
